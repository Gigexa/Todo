# Todo
First full stack project 
The project might be changed in the future with some extra updates, it has some bugs, in case you feel like reporting it to me please feel free, I am a beginner developer and I will be thankful. 

run the server side script named TodoApi.py to run api; open file and edit the host, generally it will run on local host 127.0.0.0:5000
after running a server script, run TodoApp.py which will require your registration in order to function. 
after registreing an user login and fill up your todo list, which you can update once you are done with the task. 
remove button removes the data from db too, so far you can not see your archived tasks that you have accomplished, might add that later.
